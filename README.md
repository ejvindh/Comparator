Comparator
==========
Comparator is a javascript library that can be used to host a dynamic comparison-generator on websites.

When installed, the webeditor merely needs to write "positions" in to the nodes.xml file, and comparison sentences into the relations.xml file. Then the library will create a circle with the positions. Click the nodes in order to move them into the center, and then click the appearing connection-buttons in order to see comparisons.

### Development:
